# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It features a clean and responsive interface, allowing users to play the game in their web browsers. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.

## Usage

- Tap on any box in the game board to make a move.
- The game displays a message indicating whose turn it is.
- The game ends when a player wins or when there's a tie.
- Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board is filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
